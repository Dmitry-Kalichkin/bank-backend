## Bank's backend services

> **NOTICE.**
Tests where provided for services in corresponding repositories, now only loans repository (old version) is open.
If you want, you can find commit, where I remove tests due to specific circumstances and look previous one. There where unit, integration and P2P tests for not secured services.


Services with strange requirements for backend part of bank project.

> In this case, backend service - service,
that doesn't have a GUI.
Frontend services is a services with GUI,
and they can use backend services, not vise versa.

### Deploying

If you want to use this backend serves, 
you have to run docker-compose files.

_First of all, we have to run databases:_

```
$ docker compose -f .infra/dc-databases.yml up -d
```

_After that,
since our application using kafka_:

```
$ docker compose -f .infra/dc-kafka.yml up -d
```

> IMPORTANT. Make sure that  all services are running.

_Finally, start zipkin_:

```
$ docker compose -f .infra/dc-zipkin.yml up -d
```

_After that you can run main services._

### Swagger

_Accounts service:_
```
$ http://localhost:8080/api/v2/accounts/swagger-ui/index.html
```

_Loans service:_
```
$ http://localhost:8080/api/v2/loans/swagger-ui/index.html
```

_Users service also have swagger, but you can't use this service for now,
but if you want, yu have to create user in database with bcrypto encoded password:_
```
http://localhost:8000/api/v2/users/swagger-ui/index.html
```

 If you don't use gateway, change ports
 - Loans service    - 8181
 - Accounts service - 8081
### Future

- Use security to protect resource servers and so on.
Now it's impossible to test and, because of that, not done.
- Carry out tests from archive repositories.
- May be use k8s
- Refactoring
